# Learning-Unity
This repository will house the lessons taught in my Unity course.


The course can be found here: https://www.udemy.com/make-mobile-games-like-a-pro-using-unity-game-engine/learn/v4/content

All code deposited here will be raw C#.  The Unity engine works in conjunction with C# code and as such requires additional steps for code to be functional.
